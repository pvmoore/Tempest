convert to Java 5.0

test nested functions

continue with intervals.
add type length parsing to Column.

make sure that "Identifiers" work

handle GROUP BY and HAVING
test nulls in _ROW and check out group by ??!
distinct

implement DELETE
implement UPDATE

implement aggregate functions

need to adapt RowIterator to cycle over more than 1 table if specified

handle JOINs
handle UNIONs

insert needs to use ValueExpressions instead of literals in values.

Database and Catalog may be different name for same thing
 - may drop catalog and just have database.schema.table.column
 - or always have only DEFAULT catalog in database (1)

need to create INFORMATION_SCHEMA in Catalog

use SQL.execute() method to execute sql instead of inside
- constructor and possibly getters and setters

add int(),long(),double() methods to data types
 - optimization

rewrite RowIterator.getNext()
test wheres further

test nulls with ValueExpressions and BooleanExpressions
